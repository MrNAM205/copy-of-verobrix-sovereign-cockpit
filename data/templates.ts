MOTION TO INVOKE RIGHTS UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION
ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (UNDRIP) AND DEMAND FOR FIDUCIARY COMPLIANCE

COMES NOW {{party_name}}, an Indigenous National of the {{nation}}, appearing Sui Juris, and hereby moves this Court to recognize and enforce rights guaranteed under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), adopted by the General Assembly on September 13, 2007, and endorsed by the United States.

I. INVOCATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
The Undersigned invokes the following Articles of UNDRIP, which constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world:

1. Article 3 (Self-Determination): "Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development."
2. Article 4 (Autonomy): "Indigenous peoples... have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs."
3. Article 26 (Land & Resources): "Indigenous peoples have the right to the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired."

II. SUPREMACY CLAUSE & FIDUCIARY DUTY
Under Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Supremacy Clause), all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land. While UNDRIP is a declaration, it reflects customary international law and the fiduciary obligations of the United States toward Indigenous peoples.

The Respondent/State has a fiduciary duty to protect the rights of the Undersigned and acts ultra vires when attempting to subject an Indigenous National to municipal statutes that conflict with rights of self-determination and autonomy.

III. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the Undersigned demands:
1. Judicial Notice of UNDRIP and the status of the Undersigned.
2. Dismissal of any charges or claims that infringe upon the right to self-determination and autonomy.
3. Strict compliance with the requirement for Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (Article 19).

Executed without prejudice.

NOTICE OF INTERNATIONAL STANDING AND UNIFIED INVOCATION OF RIGHTS
(UNDRIP, ADRIP, ILO 169)

TO THE COURT AND ALL OFFICERS OF THE STATE:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that {{party_name}}, an Indigenous National of the {{nation}}, hereby invokes the protections and recognitions afforded by International Law, specifically:

I. AMERICAN DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (ADRIP)
- Article 6 (Equality): Asserting the right to full enjoyment of human rights and freedom from discrimination.
- Article 9 (Juridical Personality): Asserting the recognition of the Undersigned's juridical personality and legal systems, distinct from the corporate state.
- Article 12 (Identity): Asserting the right to cultural and historical identity.
- Article 15 (Self-Determination): Asserting the right to freely determine political status.

II. ILO CONVENTION 169 (INDIGENOUS AND TRIBAL PEOPLES)
- Article 2 (Protection): Demanding the government perform its duty to protect the integrity of the Undersigned.
- Article 8 (Customary Law): Demanding that due regard be given to the customs and customary law of the {{nation}}.

III. UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION ON THE RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (UNDRIP)
- Invoking Articles 3, 4, and 26 regarding Self-Determination, Autonomy, and Land Rights.

IV. JURISDICTIONAL CHALLENGE
By virtue of these international instruments and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, this Court lacks jurisdiction to impose municipal or statutory encumbrances upon the Undersigned without Free, Prior, and Informed Consent. The Undersigned is not a ward of the state, nor a chattel, but a holder of inherent rights recognized by the family of nations.

Any action taken against the Undersigned in violation of these Declarations constitutes a breach of international obligations and fiduciary duty.

GOVERN YOURSELVES ACCORDINGLY.
